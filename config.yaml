      Cloud Native Rejekts EU 2026 is the b-side conference giving a second chance to the many
      wonderful, but rejected talks leading to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe.

      Cloud Native Rejekts EU 2026 will be an in-person conference. We hope to see you in Amsterdam, on March 21 on the heels of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe.

      See you in March!

        Sponsoring Cloud Native Rejekts not only supports the wider cloud native
        community leading into the week's main event. It's also a chance to present your company, product, and messaging
        in a more relaxed and fun setting than the typical trade show. Want to support the Cloud Native Rejekts EU 2026?
